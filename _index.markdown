# Topology 2333 ' BLOG !

## _Welcome to my blog_

**Topology2333** is actually a plain student who loves mathematics, physics as well as computer science.

On a usual moring, the college teacher asked us to build our own blog, and that is the beginninng of the story.

`$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$`

(without an explicit meaning......)


In my blog, I'll not only include the acdamic theme, but also share some intersting things I experienced and some interesting people I encountered.
